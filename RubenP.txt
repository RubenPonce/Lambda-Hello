Hello my name is Ruben Ponce. 
3 words that describe me: Coffee, chemistry, code.
 My favorite hobby is keeping up with the latest animes and simulcasts. Some of my favorites are Hokuto no Ken, JoJo's bizzare Adventure, Boku no hero...and The list stretches on forever, but I love those shounen type animes.
